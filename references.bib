  abstract = {When people are asked to retrieve members of a category from memory, clusters of semantically related items tend to be retrieved together. A recent article by Hills, Jones, and Todd (2012) argued that this pattern reflects a process similar to optimal strategies for foraging for food in patchy spatial environments, with an individual making a strategic decision to switch away from a cluster of related information as it becomes depleted. We demonstrate that similar behavioral phenomena also emerge from a random walk on a semantic network derived from human word-association data. Random walks provide an alternative account of how people search their memories, postulating an undirected rather than a strategic search process. We show that results resembling optimal foraging are produced by random walks when related items are close together in the semantic network. These findings are reminiscent of arguments from the debate on mental imagery, showing how different processes can produce similar results when operating on different representations.

  abstract = {A neuroethological approach to decision-making considers the effect of evolutionary pressures on neural circuits mediating choice. In this view, decision systems are expected to enhance fitness with respect to the local environment, and particularly efficient solutions to specific problems should be conserved, expanded, and repurposed to solve other problems. Here, we discuss basic prerequisites for a variety of decision systems from this viewpoint. We focus on two of the best-studied and most widely represented decision problems. First, we examine patch leaving, a prototype of environmentally based switching between action patterns. Second, we consider social information seeking, a process resembling foraging with search costs. We argue that while the specific neural solutions to these problems sometimes differ across species, both the problems themselves and the algorithms instantiated by biological hardware are repeated widely throughout nature. The behavioral and mathematical study of ubiquitous decision processes like patch leaving and social information seeking thus provides a powerful new approach to uncovering the fundamental design structure of nervous systems.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in machine learning among business leaders and decision makers demands that researchers explore its use within business organisations. One of the major issues facing business leaders within companies is the loss of talented employees. This research studies employee attrition using machine learning models. Using a synthetic data created by IBM Watson, three main experiments were conducted to predict employee attrition. The first experiment involved training the original class-imbalanced dataset with the following machine learning models: support vector machine (SVM) with several kernel functions, random forest and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). The second experiment focused on using adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) approach to overcome class imbalance, then retraining on the new dataset using the abovementioned machine learning models. The third experiment involved using manual undersampling of the data to balance between classes. As a result, training an ADASYN-balanced dataset with KNN (K = 3) achieved the highest performance, with 0.93 F1-score. Finally, by using feature selection and random forest, F1-score of 0.909 was achieved using 12 features out of a total of 29 features.},

  abstract = {Background Researchers in environmental psychology, health studies and urban design are interested in the relationship between the environment, behaviour settings and emotions. In particular, happiness, or the presence of positive emotional mindsets, broadens an individual's thought-action repertoire with positive benefits to physical and intellectual activities, and to social and psychological resources. This occurs through play, exploration or similar activities. In addition, a body of restorative literature focuses on the potential benefits to emotional recovery from stress offered by green space and `soft fascination'. However, access to the cortical correlates of emotional states of a person actively engaged within an environment has not been possible until recently. This study investigates the use of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) as a method to record and analyse the emotional experience of a group of walkers in three types of urban environment including a green space setting.
Methods Using Emotiv EPOC, a low-cost mobile EEG recorder, participants took part in a 25 min walk through three different areas of Edinburgh. The areas (of approximately equal length) were labelled zone 1 (urban shopping street), zone 2 (path through green space) and zone 3 (street in a busy commercial district). The equipment provided continuous recordings from five channels, labelled excitement (short-term), frustration, engagement, long-term excitement (or arousal) and meditation.
Results A new form of high-dimensional correlated component logistic regression analysis showed evidence of lower frustration, engagement and arousal, and higher meditation when moving into the green space zone; and higher engagement when moving out of it.
Conclusions Systematic differences in EEG recordings were found between three urban areas in line with restoration theory. This has implications for promoting urban green space as a mood-enhancing environment for walking or for other forms of physical or reflective activity.},

Today companies face employee attrition as the major issue effecting the productive functioning of the organization. HR analyticss has enhanced the area of data analytics to an extent that organizations can figure out their employees' characteristics; where inaccuracy leads to incorrect decision making. Data mining is helping the HR department with methods to evaluate the historical data and predict the employee attrition, the baseline for this research. By far, employee attrition is predicted with the suggestions of the domain experts and the use of the classification methods by technical researchers. This research aims to investigate the extent to which ML techniques can help in predicting the employees who might leave, using the optimal hybrid ML models, where oversampling technique (SMOTE) \& feature selection technique (SA) are integrated with the classication algorithms such as SVM \& LR. The focus is towards the true positive accuracy predicted by the models. A comparison of these results was done between the features selected by the models in this research and the ones listed by the domain expert researchers in the past to see which one has the more reliable outcomes, concluding that the management expert should use the technical methods for their analysis in future to have reliable outcomes. This will help the HR system to adopt the right scenarios in real time \& correctly predict the potential employees to leave \& know why they do so.},

In ecology, such research has often focused on the development of two movement models: (i) the L{\'e}vy walk and (ii) the composite correlated random walk and its associated area-restricted search behaviour. Although the processes underlying these models differ, they can produce similar movement patterns. Due to this similarity and because of their disparate formulation, current methods cannot reliably differentiate between these two models. Here, we present a method that differentiates between the two models. It consists of likelihood functions, including one for a hidden Markov model, and associated statistical measures that assess the relative support for and absolute fit of each model. Using a simulation study, we show that our method can differentiate between the two search models over a range of parameter values. Using the movement data of two polar bears (Ursus maritimus), we show that the method can be applied to complex, real-world movement paths. By providing the means to differentiate between the two most prominent search models in the literature, and a framework that could be extended to include other models, we facilitate further research into the strategies animals use to find resources.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the L{\'e}vy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. L{\'e}vy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain L{\'e}vy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the L{\'e}vy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and L{\'e}vy walks. This model shows that L{\'e}vy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing L{\'e}vy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the L{\'e}vy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. L{\'e}vy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain L{\'e}vy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the L{\'e}vy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and L{\'e}vy walks. This model shows that L{\'e}vy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing L{\'e}vy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.},

In this article, I review recent research showing that selective retrieval can also improve recall of other items. This research points to a critical role of context retrieval in selective memory retrieval. The concept of context retrieval, which has played a prominent role in other lines of memory research, suggests that selective retrieval can reactivate the retrieved items' temporal context during study, facilitating recall of other items that had a similar context at study. Such facilitatory effects on recall can arise both when selective item repetition occurs via retrieval and when it occurs via restudy, which suggests a link to the reminding literature. The findings offer new perspectives for investigating and understanding the effects of selective memory retrieval.},

Animals that carry resources back to a particular site are called central place foragers (CPFs), and they generally have a nest to which they bring resources. Central place foragers differ from the rest in that their activities include an outbound journey, a period of searching, and then a return journey. For example, birds carry food back to nestlings or capture prey while diving in the sea and carry it back to a terrestrial feeding site; bees transport nectar and pollen back to the hive.},

For a powerful test of these accounts, individual semantic memory structure was modelled with a novel method based on semantic relatedness judgements and different criteria for network filtering were compared. The executive account was supported by a correlation between creative ability and broad retrieval ability. The associative account was independently supported, when network filtering was based on a relatedness threshold, but not when it was based on a fixed edge number or on the analysis of weighted networks. In the former case, creative ability was associated with shorter average path lengths and higher clustering of the network, suggesting that the semantic networks of creative people show higher small-worldness.},

  abstract = {L{\'e}vy walks (LW) are superdiffusive and scale-free random walks that have recently emerged as a new conceptual tool for modeling animal search paths. They have been claimed to be more efficient than the ``classical'' random walks, and they also seem able to account for the actual search patterns of various species. This suggests that many animals may move using a LW process. LW patterns look like the actual search patterns displayed by animals foraging in a patchy environment, where extensive and intensive searching modes alternate, and which can be generated by a mixture of classical random walks. In this context, even elementary composite Brownian walks are more efficient than LW but may be confounded with them because they present apparent move-length-heavy tail distributions and superdiffusivity. The move-length ``survival'' distribution (i.e., the cumulative number of moves greater than any given threshold) appears to be a better means to highlight a LW pattern. Even once such a pattern has been clearly identified, it remains to determine how it was actually generated, because a LW pattern is not necessarily produced by a LW process but may emerge from the way the animal interacted with the environment structure through more classical movement processes. In any case, emergent movement patterns should not be confused with the processes that gave rise to them.},

Researchers in many disciplines have been searching for the optimal solution to this dilemma. Here we present a novel model in which the exploration strategy itself is dynamic and varies with time in order to optimize a definite goal, such as the acquisition of energy, money, or prestige. Our model produced four very distinct phases: Knowledge establishment, Knowledge accumulation, Knowledge maintenance, and Knowledge exploitation, giving rise to a multidisciplinary framework that applies equally to humans, animals, and organizations. The framework can be used to explain a multitude of phenomena in various disciplines, such as the movement of animals in novel landscapes, the most efficient resource allocation for a start-up company, or the effects of old age on knowledge acquisition in humans.},

  abstract = {The theoretical basis for understanding how human forager mobility should respond to environmental change rests on two models: patch choice and the marginal value theorem. Students of hunter\textendash{}gatherers have traditionally understood the more widely favored marginal value theorem to predict that use of a given patch will be more intensive, i.e., that a greater fraction of its resources will be used, when overall (environmental) return rate decreases. We show this is true only if that patch is less affected by resource decrease than others in the environment, in the simplest case, where the number of patches available to a forager decreases without affecting the quality of the remaining patches. Then, foraging time within the patch, fraction of patch resources used, and travel time between patches will all increase. Conversely, if resources decrease across all patches uniformly, the fraction of patch resources extracted from any given patch remains constant. Within-patch foraging time may or may not decrease, but will not increase. In this case, foraging time varies independently of fraction of patch resources used and travel time. The extent to which these marginal value predictions account for hunter\textendash{}gatherer mobility requires disentangling them from predictions independently generated by the patch choice model, in which as environmental quality declines, lower ranking patches are added to the foraging itinerary, decreasing travel time and either increasing or decreasing foraging time, depending on the nature of the lower ranking patches. A sample of 190 mobile hunter\textendash{}gatherers suggests that a version of the patch choice model in which the patches added to the foraging itinerary are more difficult to search, and contain greater quantities of resources with higher handling times, best accounts for observed variation in foraging and travel time overall.},

These latter regions, which include the inferior parietal lobe and much of the temporal lobe, lie at convergences of multiple perceptual processing streams. These convergences enable increasingly abstract, supramodal representations of perceptual experience that support a variety of conceptual functions including object recognition, social cognition, language, and the remarkable human capacity to remember the past and imagine the future.},

The neural systems that store and retrieve this information have been studied for many years, but a consensus regarding their identity has not been reached. Using strict inclusion criteria, we analyzed 120 functional neuroimaging studies focusing on semantic processing. Reliable areas of activation in these studies were identified using the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) technique. These activations formed a distinct, left-lateralized network comprised of 7 regions: posterior inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus. Secondary analyses showed specific subregions of this network associated with knowledge of actions, manipulable artifacts, abstract concepts, and concrete concepts. The cortical regions involved in semantic processing can be grouped into 3 broad categories: posterior multimodal and heteromodal association cortex, heteromodal prefrontal cortex, and medial limbic regions. The expansion of these regions in the human relative to the nonhuman primate brain may explain uniquely human capacities to use language productively, plan, solve problems, and create cultural and technological artifacts, all of which depend on the fluid and efficient retrieval and manipulation of semantic knowledge.},

We introduce a minimal exploitation-migration model that incorporates the coupling between a searcher's trajectory, modeled by a random walk, and ensuing depletion of the environment by the searcher's consumption of resources. The searcher also migrates to a new patch when it takes S consecutive steps without finding resources. We compute the distribution of consumed resources Ft at time t for this non-Markovian searcher and show that consumption is maximized by exploring multiple patches. In one dimension, we derive the optimal strategy to maximize Ft. This strategy is robust with respect to the distribution of resources within patches and the criterion for leaving the current patch. We also show that Ft has an optimum in the ecologically relevant case of two-dimensional patchy environments.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of chronic stress on hippocampal-dependent function, based primarily upon studies using young, adult male rodents and spatial navigation tasks. Despite this restriction, variability amongst the findings was evident and how or even whether chronic stress influenced spatial ability depended upon the type of task, the dependent variable measured and how the task was implemented, the type and duration of the stressors, housing conditions of the animals that include accessibility to food and cage mates, and duration from the end of the stress to the start of behavioral assessment. Nonetheless, patterns emerged as follows: For spatial memory, chronic stress impairs spatial reference memory and has transient effects on spatial working memory. For spatial learning, however, chronic stress effects appear to be task-specific: chronic stress impairs spatial learning on appetitively motivated tasks, such as the radial arm maze or holeboard, tasks that evoke relatively mild to low arousal components from fear. But under testing conditions that evoke moderate to strong arousal components from fear, such as during radial arm water maze testing, chronic stress appears to have minimal impairing effects or may even facilitate spatial learning. Chronic stress clearly impacts nearly every brain region and thus, how chronic stress alters hippocampal spatial ability likely depends upon the engagement of other brain structures during behavioral training and testing.},

A quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult Drosophila melanogaster. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection.},

Our results indicate that the data generated through walking interviews are profoundly informed by the landscapes in which they take place, emphasising the importance of environmental features in shaping discussions. We also demonstrate a measureable difference between walking and sedentary techniques in the production of rich place narratives both in terms of their quantity and spatial specificity to the study area. The paper concludes by acknowledging that a technocentric analysis of place runs the risk of emphasising locational above humanistic elements, but argues that, done sensitively, a qualitative GIS approach offers great potential for engaging planners and policy makers with the importance of local connections to place.},

  abstract = {How do we remember our experiences? The mental skill of bringing previously encountered people, events, and objects to mind is intuitive, but how neural circuits enable this episodic memory retrieval remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. On page 975 of this issue, Vaz et al. ([ 1 ][1]) use intracranial electrophysiological recordings in humans to identify a putative mechanism involved in memory retrieval: synchronized occurrence of high-frequency oscillations across brain regions. Their findings highlight the importance of dynamic interactions between brain areas in mediating complex cognitive processes and suggest a biomarker for pinpointing neural populations involved in different memories.

Early studies of patients with neurologic diseases such as epilepsy established that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is critical for episodic memory ([ 2 ][2]), but this brain region does not operate in isolation. Structural brain connectivity reveals that the MTL has dense reciprocal connections with association cortices (areas that perform multimodal, advanced information processing), which in turn communicate with the primary cortices (areas that receive sensory signals, such as sounds, from the environment) ([ 3 ][3]). The position of the MTL at the apex of this pyramid of information flow enables it to integrate multimodal sensory information in space and time, setting the stage for episodic memory encoding and retrieval. Therefore, the search for neural signatures of this memory type focuses on interactions between the MTL and connected structures. Vaz et al. were able to simultaneously investigate the neural activity occurring in these brain regions by analyzing data from patients undergoing electrophysiological mapping as part of a clinical work-up for epilepsy surgery.

How can such interactions between brain structures be identified? Activity in neural populations often takes the form of oscillations that can parse individual neurons' action potentials into precisely timed chunks suitable for transmission to connected populations ([ 4 ][4]). Furthermore, when separate brain regions jointly engage in oscillatory activity, intercortical communication is facilitated because action potentials can arrive during a period of heightened neuronal excitability, increasing the likelihood that the incoming signal will engage local neural networks in relevant processing ([ 5 ][5]). Periods of oscillatory coupling between brain regions can thereby establish preferential communication channels during discrete epochs in time.

Ripples are high-frequency (110 to 200 Hz) oscillations initially characterized in the rodent hippocampus that are extensively implicated in transmitting information within memory networks ([ 6 ][6]). These short (40 to 100 ms) oscillations are the most highly synchronized physiological events in the brain, inducing robust increases in neural excitability locally and within connected brain regions ([ 7 ][7]). Most importantly, studies in rodents demonstrated that activity of individual neurons (neural spiking) during ripples is highly organized and can represent a temporally compressed version of neural activity patterns that occur during previous waking experiences ([ 8 ][8]). Hippocampal ripples can also induce reactivation of neural spiking patterns in downstream targets, such as the medial prefrontal cortex ([ 9 ][9]) and posterior parietal cortex ([ 10 ][10]). Because ripples occur frequently during waking immobility and non\textendash{}rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, they are posited to facilitate information transfer between hippocampal and neocortical networks by replaying waking neural activity during offline states ([ 11 ][11]).

Numerous experimental observations have expanded the diversity of ripples beyond the hippocampus, including ripples that occur in humans ([ 12 ][12], [ 13 ][13]) and in rodent association cortices ([ 14 ][14]). Vaz et al. contribute to these findings by characterizing ripples in the human MTL, as well as in association and primary cortices. What is the relationship, if any, between ripples that occur in these different brain regions, and how does their existence inform our understanding of neural networks involved in memory? In rodents, the occurrence of ripples in the hippocampus and association cortex is correlated ([ 14 ][14]). Similarly, Vaz et al. found that ripples in the MTL were significantly coupled to ripples in the temporal association cortex (a region involved in language and multisensory integration), but not primary cortices. These results suggest that dynamic high-frequency oscillatory coupling may establish specific time windows for preferential communication between the MTL and association cortices, enabling these brain regions to effectively cooperate in information processing.

Vaz et al. establish the functional importance of this interregional ripple coupling during a memory task wherein human participants recall new associations between pairs of words. They find that both the occurrence rate and degree of MTL\textendash{}temporal association cortex ripple coupling increase selectively during trials with successful memory performance. These effects were not observed in other association cortices (such as prefrontal or parietal cortices), which were presumably not required for the performance of this language-based task. The demonstration that ripple coupling between the MTL and different association cortices can be driven by varying task requirements would further strengthen the mechanistic interpretation of this phenomenon.

Ripples are synchronized between the medial temporal lobe and temporal association cortex during successful memory retrieval, but not during baseline conditions.

GRAPHIC: N. CARY/ SCIENCE 

The study of Vaz et al. with human participants also permits key insight into the neural mechanisms specifically involved in memory retrieval (accessing a previously stored memory), rather than memory consolidation (strengthening a memory for long-term storage), which has been well studied in animal models ([ 15 ][16]). The memory task employed by Vaz et al. involved acquiring a timed verbal response or a pass on any given trial. They found that increases in ripple occurrence and coupling occurred during successful memory retrieval, but not during pass or incorrect trials or during encoding (when the memory is first established). Coupled ripples were also associated with a reinstatement of cortical activity patterns that were present during encoding of the word pair to be remembered, offering the possibility that the ripples may ``prime'' the network for the subsequent conscious process of recollection in this task.

Coupled ripples may serve as a biomarker for the ``when'' and ``where'' of memory retrieval in the brain, but the neural spiking sequences embedded in their oscillatory cycles define ``what'' is being retrieved (see the figure). Further investigation into these neural signals will help us to understand the syntax (4) that forms the basis of our experiential memories, and perhaps lay the foundation for interventions aimed at improving memory function.

  abstract = {The movement paths of individuals over landscapes are basically represented by sequences of points (xi, yi) occurring at times ti. Theoretically, these points can be viewed as being generated by stochastic processes that in the simplest cases are Gaussian random walks on featureless landscapes. Generalizations have been made of walks that (i) take place on landscapes with features, (ii) have correlated distributions of velocity and direction of movement in each time interval, (iii) are L{\'e}vy processes in which distance or waiting-time (time-between steps) distributions have infinite moments, or (iv) have paths bounded in space and time. We begin by demonstrating that rather mild truncations of fat-tailed step-size distributions have a dramatic effect on dispersion of organisms, where such truncations naturally arise in real walks of organisms bounded by space and, more generally, influenced by the interactions of physiological, behavioral, and ecological factors with landscape features. These generalizations permit not only increased realism and hence greater accuracy in constructing movement pathways, but also provide a biogeographically detailed epistemological framework for interpreting movement patterns in all organisms, whether tossed in the wind or willfully driven. We illustrate the utility of our framework by demonstrating how fission\textendash{}fusion herding behavior arises among individuals endeavoring to satisfy both nutritional and safety demands in heterogeneous environments. We conclude with a brief discussion of potential methods that can be used to solve the inverse problem of identifying putative causal factors driving movement behavior on known landscapes, leaving details to references in the literature.},

While stress effects on various types of memory are well characterized, its effects on other cognitive functions are relatively unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of acute, uncontrollable stress on subsequent decision-making performance in rats, using a computer vision-based water foraging choice task. Experiencing stress significantly impaired the animals' ability to progressively bias (but not maintain) their responses toward the larger reward when transitioning from equal to unequal reward quantities. Temporary inactivation of the amygdala during stress, however, blocked impairing effects on decision making.},

  abstract = {In applied settings, such as aviation, medicine, and finance, individuals make decisions under various degrees of uncertainty, that is, when not all risks are known or can be calculated. In such situations, decisions can be made using fast-and-frugal heuristics. These are simple strategies that ignore part of the available information. In this article, we propose that the conceptual lens of fast-and-frugal heuristics is useful not only for describing but also for improving applied decision making. By exploiting features of the environment and capabilities of the decision makers, heuristics can be simple without trading off accuracy. Because decision aids based on heuristics build on how individuals make decisions, they can be adopted intuitively and used effectively. Beyond enabling accurate decisions, heuristics possess characteristics that facilitate their adaptation to varied settings. These characteristics include accessibility, speed, transparency, and cost effectiveness. Altogether, the article offers an overview of the literature on fast-and-frugal heuristics and their usefulness in diverse applied settings.},

  abstract = {Foraging- and feeding-related behaviors across eumetazoans share similar molecular mechanisms, suggesting the early evolution of an optimal foraging behavior called area-restricted search (ARS), involving mechanisms of dopamine and glutamate in the modulation of behavioral focus. Similar mechanisms in the vertebrate basal ganglia control motor behavior and cognition and reveal an evolutionary progression toward increasing internal connections between prefrontal cortex and striatum in moving from amphibian to primate. The basal ganglia in higher vertebrates show the ability to transfer dopaminergic activity from unconditioned stimuli to conditioned stimuli. The evolutionary role of dopamine in the modulation of goal-directed behavior and cognition is further supported by pathologies of human goal-directed cognition, which have motor and cognitive dysfunction and organize themselves, with respect to dopaminergic activity, along the gradient described by ARS, from perseverative to unfocused. The evidence strongly supports the evolution of goal-directed cognition out of mechanisms initially in control of spatial foraging but, through increasing cortical connections, eventually used to forage for information.},

  abstract = {When searching for concepts in memory\textemdash{}as in the verbal fluency task of naming all the animals one can think of\textemdash{}people appear to explore internal mental representations in much the same way that animals forage in physical space: searching locally within patches of information before transitioning globally between patches. However, the definition of the patches being searched in mental space is not well specified. Do we search by activating explicit predefined categories (e.g., pets) and recall items from within that category (categorical search), or do we activate and recall a connected sequence of individual items without using categorical information, with each item recalled leading to the retrieval of an associated item in a stream (associative search), or both? Using semantic representations in a search of associative memory framework and data from the animal fluency task, we tested competing hypotheses based on associative and categorical search models. Associative, but not categorical, patch transitions took longer to make than position-matched productions, suggesting that categorical transitions were not true transitions. There was also clear evidence of associative search even within categorical patch boundaries. Furthermore, most individuals' behavior was best explained by an associative search model without the addition of categorical information. Thus, our results support a search process that does not use categorical information, but for which patch boundaries shift with each recall and local search is well described by a random walk in semantic space, with switches to new regions of the semantic space when the current region is depleted.},

  abstract = {High levels of locus coeruleus (LC) tonic activity are associated with distraction and poor performance within a task. Adaptive gain theory (AGT; Aston-Jones \& Cohen, 2005) suggests that this may reflect an adaptive function of the LC, encouraging search for more remunerative opportunities in times of low utility. Here, we examine whether stimulating LC tonic activity using designer receptors (DREADDs) promotes searching for better opportunities in a patch-foraging task as the value of a patch diminishes. The task required rats to decide repeatedly whether to exploit an immediate but depleting reward within a patch or to incur the cost of a time delay to travel to a new, fuller patch. Similar to behavior associated with high LC tonic activity in other tasks, we found that stimulating LC tonic activity impaired task performance, resulting in reduced task participation and increased response times and omission rates. However, this was accompanied by a more specific, predicted effect: a significant tendency to leave patches earlier, which was best explained by an increase in decision noise rather than a systematic bias to leave earlier (i.e., at higher values). This effect is consistent with the hypothesis that high LC tonic activity favors disengagement from current behavior, and the pursuit of alternatives, by augmenting processing noise. These results provide direct causal evidence for the relationship between LC tonic activity and flexible task switching proposed by AGT.},

  abstract = {Behavioral economic studies involving limited numbers of choices have provided key insights into neural decision-making mechanisms. By contrast, animals' foraging choices arise in the context of sequences of encounters with prey or food. On each encounter, the animal chooses whether to engage or, if the environment is sufficiently rich, to search elsewhere. The cost of foraging is also critical. We demonstrate that humans can alternate between two modes of choice, comparative decision-making and foraging, depending on distinct neural mechanisms in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using distinct reference frames; in ACC, choice variables are represented in invariant reference to foraging or searching for alternatives. Whereas vmPFC encodes values of specific well-defined options, ACC encodes the average value of the foraging environment and cost of foraging.

The results showed that job satisfaction increased with age. Younger employees were less satisfied overall with their jobs, but especially with the intrinsic characteristics of the work. Older employees were more satisfied with the extrinsic characteristics than were the two younger groups of employees. When the effects of salary, job tenure, and education were removed independently as well as simultaneously, the same differences were found. However, when the effect of job characteristics was added to the combination and partialled out, the intrinsic characteristics factor was no longer significant.},

The model is developed for a target detection task for which there is extant single neuron recording data available from locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons. An exploration-exploitation trade-off is elicited by regularly switching which of the two stimuli are rewarded. DA functions within the model to change synaptic weights according to a reinforcement learning algorithm. Exploration is mediated by the state of LC firing, with higher tonic and lower phasic activity producing greater response variability. The opposite state of LC function, with lower baseline firing rate and greater phasic responses, favors exploitative behavior. Changes in LC firing mode result from combined measures of response conflict and reward rate, where response conflict is monitored using models of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Increased long-term response conflict and decreased reward rate, which occurs following reward contingency switch, favors the higher tonic state of LC function and NE release. This increases exploration, and facilitates discovery of the new target.},

In view of this, there is this never-ending pursuit of that competitive advantage a company can utilize to stay at least a step ahead of competition. Many others have looked at developing superior and more technologically advanced products while other have looked in improving their services. But no matter what strategy a company employs, there will always be a need for them to have good people. Good, motivated, satisfied, involved and committed people. Without this, nothing can ever be accomplished. The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among these motivation management variables-job satisfaction, job involvement and organizational commitment. Furthermore, this study would like to find out if job involvement can be a mediating variable between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Respondents in this study were employees of a small and medium sized business enterprise engaged in the manufacturing of processed meat products. Data collection was done using online questionnaire in combination with face to face interview. Findings indicated that job satisfaction can be good predictor of organizational commitment and job involvement among employees of a small and medium-sized business entity here in the Philippines. Job involvement also significantly mediated the impact of job satisfaction on employee organizational commitment. Results of this study can be used as a reinforcement as to how important job satisfaction is with regards employee motivation management. Job satisfaction among employees may also contribute in making sure that they become committed to the organization as well as involved with their jobs. Furthermore, results of this study can also be used by scholars in further probing the various control variables that may be used in further enhancing and improving the current model at hand.},

However, until recently{$\mkern1mu$}, relatively little attention has been paid to the extent to which the structure of experimental environments relates to natural scenarios, and the survival problems that individuals have evolved to solve. This situation not only risks leaving decision-theoretic accounts ungrounded but also makes various aspects of the solutions, such as hard-wired or Pavlovian policies, difficult to interpret in the natural world. Here, we suggest importing concepts, paradigms and approaches from the fields of ethology and behavioural ecology{$\mkern1mu$}, which concentrate on the contextual and functional correlates of decisions made about foraging and escape and address these lacunae.},

  abstract = {Our daily interaction with the world is plagued of situations in which we develop experience through self-motivated repetition of the same task. In many of these interactions, and especially when dealing with computer and machine interfaces, we must deal with sequences of decisions and actions. For instance, when drawing cash from an ATM machine, choices are presented in a step-by-step fashion and a specific sequence of choices must be performed in order to produce the expected outcome. But, as we become experts in the use of such interfaces, is it possible to identify specific search and learning strategies? And if so, can we use this information to predict future actions? In addition to better understanding the cognitive processes underlying sequential decision making, this could allow building adaptive interfaces that can facilitate interaction at different moments of the learning curve. Here we tackle the question of modeling sequential decision-making behavior in a simple human-computer interface that instantiates a 4-level binary decision tree (BDT) task. We record behavioral data from voluntary participants while they attempt to solve the task. Using a Hidden Markov Model-based approach that capitalizes on the hierarchical structure of behavior, we then model their performance during the interaction. Our results show that partitioning the problem space into a small set of hierarchically related stereotyped strategies can potentially capture a host of individual decision making policies. This allows us to follow how participants learn and develop expertise in the use of the interface. Moreover, using a Mixture of Experts based on these stereotyped strategies, the model is able to predict the behavior of participants that master the task.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of semantic memory have investigated two theories of optimal search adopted from the animal foraging literature: L{\'e}vy flights and marginal value theorem. Each theory makes different simplifying assumptions and addresses different findings in search behaviors. In this study, an experiment is conducted to test whether clustering in semantic memory may play a role in evidence for both theories. Labeled magnets and a whiteboard were used to elicit spatial representations of semantic knowledge about animals. Category recall sequences from a separate experiment were used to trace search paths over the spatial representations of animal knowledge. Results showed that spatial distances between animal names arranged on the whiteboard were correlated with inter-response intervals (IRIs) during category recall, and distributions of both dependent measures approximated inverse power laws associated with L{\'e}vy flights. In addition, IRIs were relatively shorter when paths first entered animal clusters, and longer when they exited clusters, which is consistent with marginal value theorem. In conclusion, area-restricted searches over clustered semantic spaces may account for two different patterns of results interpreted as supporting two different theories of optimal memory foraging.},

  abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a fundamental process by which organisms learn to achieve goals from their interactions with the environment. Using evolutionary computation techniques we evolve (near-)optimal neuronal learning rules in a simple neural network model of reinforcement learning in bumblebees foraging for nectar. The resulting neural networks exhibit efficient reinforcement learning, allowing the bees to respond rapidly to changes in reward contingencies. The evolved synaptic plasticity dynamics give rise to varying exploration/exploitation levels and to the well-documented choice strategies of risk aversion and probability matching. Additionally, risk aversion is shown to emerge even when bees are evolved in a completely risk-less environment. In contrast to existing theories in economics and game theory, risk-averse behavior is shown to be a direct consequence of (near-)optimal reinforcement learning, without requiring additional assumptions such as the existence of a nonlinear subjective utility function for rewards. Our results are corroborated by a rigorous mathematical analysis, and their robustness in real-world situations is supported by experiments in a mobile robot. Thus we provide a biologically founded, parsimonious, and novel explanation for risk aversion and probability matching.},

  abstract = {The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is the dominant paradigm in predicting patch use and numerous tests support its qualitative predictions. Quantitative tests under complex foraging situations could be expected to be more variable in their support because the MVT assumes behavior maximizes only net energy-intake rate. However across a survey of 26 studies, foragers rather consistently ``erred'' in staying too long in patches. Such a consistent direction to the errors suggests that the simplifying assumptions of the MVT introduce a systematic bias rather than just imprecision. Therefore, I simulated patch use as a state-dependent response to physiological state, travel cost, predation risk, prey densities, and fitness currencies other than net-rate maximization (e.g., maximizing survival, reproductive investment, or mating opportunities). State-dependent behavior consistently results in longer patch residence times than predicted by the MVT or another foraging model, the minimize {$\mu$}/g rule, and these rules fail to closely approximate the best behavioral strategy over a wide range of conditions. Because patch residence times increase with state-dependent behavior, this also predicts mass regulation below maximum energy capacities without direct mass-specific costs. Finally, qualitative behavioral predictions from the MVT about giving-up densities in patches and the effects of travel costs are often inconsistent with state-dependent behavior. Thus in order to accurately predict patch exploitation patterns, the model highlights the need to: (1) consider predator behavior (sit-and-wait versus actively foraging); (2) identify activities that can occur simultaneously to foraging (i.e., mate search or parental care); and (3) specify the range of nutritional states likely in foraging animals. Future predictive models of patch use should explicitly consider these parameters.},

Apart from extensive literature review, available till date, techniques like focus group discussion and semi-structured interviews with employees of Indian ITeS call centres, who have shifted their ITeS call centre job at least once in their career, have been conducted. It calls for reviewing the human resource policies of the call centre employees in light of employee policies implemented in other industries apart from providing better facilitation on pertinent issues like career planning, appraisal system, salary and timings to the ITeS call centre employees.},

  abstract = {It is well established that children with autism often show outstanding visual search skills. To date, however, no study has tested whether these skills, usually assessed on a table-top or computer, translate to more true-to-life settings. One prominent account of autism, Baron-Cohen's ``systemizing'' theory, gives us good reason to suspect that they should. In this study, we tested whether autistic children's exceptional skills at small-scale search extend to a large-scale environment and, in so doing, tested key claims of the systemizing account. Twenty school-age children with autism and 20 age- and ability-matched typical children took part in a large-scale search task in the ``foraging room'': a purpose-built laboratory, with numerous possible search locations embedded into the floor. Children were instructed to search an array of 16 (green) locations to find the hidden (red) target as quickly as possible. The distribution of target locations was manipulated so that they appeared on one side of the midline for 80\% of trials. Contrary to predictions of the systemizing account, autistic children's search behavior was much less efficient than that of typical children: they showed reduced sensitivity to the statistical properties of the search array, and furthermore, their search patterns were strikingly less optimal and less systematic. The nature of large-scale search behavior in autism cannot therefore be explained by a facility for systemizing. Rather, children with autism showed difficulties exploring and exploiting the large-scale space, which might instead be attributed to constraints (rather than benefits) in their cognitive repertoire.},

  abstract = {Employee turnover has been identified as a key issue for organizations because of its adverse impact on work place productivity and long term growth strategies. To solve this problem, organizations use machine learning techniques to predict employee turnover. Accurate predictions enable organizations to take action for retention or succession planning of employees. However, the data for this modeling problem comes from HR Information Systems (HRIS); these are typically under-funded compared to the Information Systems of other domains in the organization which are directly related to its priorities. This leads to the prevalence of noise in the data that renders predictive models prone to over-fitting and hence inaccurate. This is the key challenge that is the focus of this paper, and one that has not been addressed historically. The novel contribution of this paper is to explore the application of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) technique which is more robust because of its regularization formulation. Data from the HRIS of a global retailer is used to compare XGBoost against six historically used supervised classifiers and demonstrate its significantly higher accuracy for predicting employee turnover.},

  abstract = {When searching for food, many organisms adopt a superdiffusive, scale-free movement pattern called a L{\'e}vy walk, which is considered optimal when foraging for heterogeneously located resources with little prior knowledge of distribution patterns [Viswanathan GM, da Luz MGE, Raposo EP, Stanley HE (2011) The Physics of Foraging: An Introduction to Random Searches and Biological Encounters]. Although memory of food locations and higher cognition may limit the benefits of random walk strategies, no studies to date have fully explored search patterns in human foraging. Here, we show that human hunter\textendash{}gatherers, the Hadza of northern Tanzania, perform L{\'e}vy walks in nearly one-half of all foraging bouts. L{\'e}vy walks occur when searching for a wide variety of foods from animal prey to underground tubers, suggesting that, even in the most cognitively complex forager on Earth, such patterns are essential to understanding elementary foraging mechanisms. This movement pattern may be fundamental to how humans experience and interact with the world across a wide range of ecological contexts, and it may be adaptive to food distribution patterns on the landscape, which previous studies suggested for organisms with more limited cognition. Additionally, L{\'e}vy walks may have become common early in our genus when hunting and gathering arose as a major foraging strategy, playing an important role in the evolution of human mobility.},

  abstract = {In the modern era, organizations are facing several challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment. One of the many challenges for a business is to satisfy its employees in order to cope up with the ever changing and evolving environment and to achieve success and remain in competition. In order to increase efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and job commitment of employees, the business must satisfy the needs of its employees by providing good working conditions.The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of working environment on employee job satisfaction.The study employed a quantitative methodology. Data was collected through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The questionnaire is adopted from a previous validated survey. The target population consists of educational institutes, banking sector and telecommunication industry operating in the city of Quetta, Pakistan. Simple random sampling is used for collection of data from 210 employees.Theresults indicates a positive relationship between working environment and employee job satisfaction.The study concludes with some brief prospects that the businesses need to realize the importance of good working environment for maximizing the level of job satisfaction. This paper may benefit society by encouraging people to contribute more to their jobs and may help them in their personal growth and development. Hence, it is essential for an organization to motivate their employees to work hard for achieving the organizational goals and objectives.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

Retrievals decline as recall progresses, but short retrieval bursts can occur even after tens of minutes of performing the task. To date, efforts to gain insight into the nature of retrieval from this fundamental phenomenon of semantic memory have focused primarily upon the exponential growth rate of cumulative recall. Here we focus upon the time intervals between retrievals. We expected and found that, for each participant in our experiment, these intervals conformed to a L{\'e}vy distribution suggesting that the L{\'e}vy flight dynamics that characterize foraging behavior may also characterize retrieval from semantic memory. The closer the exponent on the inverse square power-law distribution of retrieval intervals approximated the optimal foraging value of 2, the more efficient was the retrieval. At an abstract dynamical level, foraging for particular foods in one's niche and searching for particular words in one's memory must be similar processes if particular foods and particular words are randomly and sparsely located in their respective spaces at sites that are not known a priori. We discuss whether L{\'e}vy dynamics imply that memory processes, like foraging, are optimized in an ecological way.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years of research have led to the general agreement that the hippocampus contributes to memory, but there has been a major schism among theories of hippocampal function over this time. Some researchers argue that the hippocampus plays a broad role in episodic and declarative memory, whereas others argue for a specific role in the creation of spatial cognitive maps and navigation. Although both views have merit, neither provides a complete account of hippocampal function. Guided by recent reviews that attempt to bridge between these views, here we suggest that reconciliation can be accomplished by exploring hippocampal function from the perspective of Tolman's (1948) original conception of a cognitive map as organizing experience and guiding behavior across all domains of cognition. We emphasize recent studies in animals and humans showing that hippocampal networks support a broad range of domains of cognitive maps, that these networks organize specific experiences within the contextually relevant map, and that network activity patterns reflect behavior guided through cognitive maps. These results are consistent with a framework that bridges theories of hippocampal function by conceptualizing the hippocampus as organizing incoming information within the context of a multidimensional cognitive map of spatial, temporal, and associational context.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Research of hippocampal function is dominated by two major views. The spatial view argues that the hippocampus tracks routes through space, whereas the memory view suggests a broad role in declarative memory. Both views rely on considerable evidence, but neither provides a complete account of hippocampal function. Here we review evidence that, in addition to spatial context, the hippocampus encodes a wide variety of information about temporal and situational context, about the systematic organization of events in abstract space, and about routes through maps of cognition and space. We argue that these findings cross the boundaries of the memory and spatial views and offer new insights into hippocampal function as a system supporting a broad range of cognitive maps.},

An alternative theory has been recently advanced that proposes that dACC evolved to represent the value of 'non-default', foraging behavior, calling into question its role in choice difficulty. However, this new theory does not take into account that choosing whether or not to pursue foraging-like behavior can also be more difficult than simply resorting to a default. The results of two neuroimaging experiments show that dACC is only associated with foraging value when foraging value is confounded with choice difficulty; when the two are dissociated, dACC engagement is only explained by choice difficulty, and not the value of foraging. In addition to refuting this new theory, our studies help to formalize a fundamental connection between choice difficulty and foraging-like decisions, while also prescribing a solution for a common pitfall in studies of reward-based decision making.},

Twenty-four hours later, they were reexposed to 5 shocks, and 30 min later, they were tested on the radial maze with the use of obvious spatial cues. Compared with the unstressed controls (n = 8), the stressed rats displayed a significantly different distribution of errors across the 12 trials, an effect attributable, in part, to their initial decrease in exploration and increase in perseveration. An equation that controls for the changing probability of choices and errors during a trial is presented, and the calculations suggest that the stressed rats are capable of learning the maze, but that their baseline behavior hinders the process. Since both stress and long-term potentiation (LTP) increase classical conditioning and both delay the acquisition of spatial information, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that stress is inducing a phenomenon similar to, if not the same as, LTP.},

This is especially important in organizations with large services arms where unplanned departures of key employees can lead to big losses by way of lost productivity, delayed or missed deadlines, and hiring costs of replacements. By proactively identifying top talent at a high risk of voluntarily leaving, an organization can take appropriate action in time to actually affect such employee departures, thereby avoiding financial and knowledge losses. The main retention action we study in this paper is that of proactive salary raises to at-risk employees. Our approach uses data mining for identifying employees at risk of attrition and balances the cost of attrition/replacement of an employee against the cost of retaining that employee (by way of increased salary) to enable the optimal use of limited funds that may be available for this purpose, thereby allowing the action to be targeted towards employees with the highest potential returns on investment. This approach has been used to do a proactive retention action for several thousand employees across several geographies and business units for a large, Fortune 500 multinational company. We discuss this action and discuss the results to date that show a significant reduction in voluntary resignations of the targeted groups.},

First, we conducted an empirical study using five real web sites from which the gaze position, pupil dilation and EEG of 21 human subjects were recorded while performing diverse information foraging tasks. We found the existence of a statistical differentiation between choice and not-choice pupil dilation curves, specifically that fixations corresponding to clicks had greater pupil size than fixations without a click. Then 7 classification models were proposed using 15 out of 789 pupil dilation and EEG features obtained from a Random Lasso feature selection process. Although good results were obtained for Accuracy (71,09\% using Logistic Regression), the results for Precision, Recall and F-Measure remained low, which indicates that the behaviour we were studying was not well classified. The above results show that it is possible to create a classifier for web user click intention behaviour based on merging features extracted from pupil dilation and EEG responses. However we conclude that it is necessary to use better quality instruments for capturing the data.},

  abstract = {Conscious memory for a new experience is initially dependent on information stored in both the hippocampus and neocortex. Systems consolidation is the process by which the hippocampus guides the reorganization of the information stored in the neocortex such that it eventually becomes independent of the hippocampus. Early evidence for systems consolidation was provided by studies of retrograde amnesia, which found that damage to the hippocampus-impaired memories formed in the recent past, but typically spared memories formed in the more remote past. Systems consolidation has been found to occur for both episodic and semantic memories and for both spatial and nonspatial memories, although empirical inconsistencies and theoretical disagreements remain about these issues. Recent work has begun to characterize the neural mechanisms that underlie the dialogue between the hippocampus and neocortex (e.g., ``neural replay,'' which occurs during sharp wave ripple activity). New work has also identified variables, such as the amount of preexisting knowledge, that affect the rate of consolidation. The increasing use of molecular genetic tools (e.g., optogenetics) can be expected to further improve understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying consolidation.},

We used functional MRI to examine the differences between manner verbs, which encode information about the manner of an action, versus instrument verbs, which encode information about an object as part of their meaning. Using both visual and verbal stimuli and a combination of univariate and multivariate pattern analyses, our results show that accessing conceptual representations of instrument class involves brain regions typically associated with complex action and object perception, including the anterior inferior parietal cortex and occipito-temporal cortex. On the other hand, accessing conceptual representations of the manner class involves regions that are commonly associated with the processing of visual and biological motion, in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. These findings support the idea that the semantics of manner and instrument verbs are supported by distinct neural mechanisms.},

Short-lived, high-frequency oscillations in the brain called ripples have been implicated as substrates for memory formation. There is, however, little evidence linking ripple activity with awake memory retrieval in humans. Vaz et al. analyzed intracranial recordings in human subjects (see the Perspective by Gelinas). They found that ripple oscillations in the brain's medial temporal lobe were coupled with ripple oscillations in the temporal cortex. This coupling was enhanced just before successful memory retrieval. During successful retrievals with ripples, patterns of oscillations were recapitulated across multiple electrodes, consistent with the initial encoding. The observation that ripple oscillations occur before successful memory retrieval suggests that they may play a mechanistic role in the retrieval process.
Science, this issue p. 975; see also p. 927
Episodic memory retrieval relies on the recovery of neural representations of waking experience. This process is thought to involve a communication dynamic between the medial temporal lobe memory system and the neocortex. How this occurs is largely unknown, however, especially as it pertains to awake human memory retrieval. Using intracranial electroencephalographic recordings, we found that ripple oscillations were dynamically coupled between the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal association cortex. Coupled ripples were more pronounced during successful verbal memory retrieval and recover the cortical neural representations of remembered items. Together, these data provide direct evidence that coupled ripples between the MTL and association cortex may underlie successful memory retrieval in the human brain.
Intracranial EEG recordings successfully reveal the link between ripple oscillations and memory retrieval in the awake human brain.

Episodic remembering is a dynamic process that draws upon mnemonic and nonmnemonic cognitive abilities in order to mentally reconstruct past experiences from retrieval cues. The neural substrates of these abilities represent a distributed set of functionally specific nervous system structures that operate in concert. The profound anterograde amnesia observed in patient HM demonstrated that the medial temporal lobes are critically involved in the formation of episodic memories, while more recent research highlights the role of other brain regions, including prefrontal and parietal cortex, in episodic memory.},

  abstract = {Bill Gates was once quoted as saying, "You take away our top 20 employees and we [Microsoft] become a mediocre company". This statement by Bill Gates took our attention to one of the major problems of employee attrition at workplaces. Employee attrition (turnover) causes a significant cost to any organization which may later on effect its overall efficiency. As per CompData Surveys, over the past five years, total turnover has increased from 15.1 percent to 18.5 percent. For any organization, finding a well trained and experienced employee is a complex task, but it's even more complex to replace such employees. This not only increases the significant Human Resource (HR) cost, but also impacts the market value of an organization. Despite these facts and ground reality, there is little attention to the literature, which has been seeded to many misconceptions between HR and Employees. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a framework for predicting the employee churn by analyzing the employee's precise behaviors and attributes using classification techniques.},

  abstract = {During foraging, animals decide how long to stay at a patch and harvest reward, and then, they move with certain vigor to another location. How does the brain decide when to leave, and how does it determine the speed of the ensuing movement? Here, we considered the possibility that both the decision-making and the motor control problems aimed to maximize a single normative utility: the sum of all rewards acquired minus all efforts expended divided by total time. This optimization could be achieved if the brain compared a local measure of utility with its history. To test the theory, we examined behavior of people as they gazed at images: they chose how long to look at the image (harvesting information) and then moved their eyes to another image, controlling saccade speed. We varied reward via image content and effort via image eccentricity, and then, we measured how these changes affected decision making (gaze duration) and motor control (saccade speed). After a history of low rewards, people increased gaze duration and decreased saccade speed. In anticipation of future effort, they lowered saccade speed and increased gaze duration. After a history of high effort, they elevated their saccade speed and increased gaze duration. Therefore, the theory presented a principled way with which the brain may control two aspects of behavior: movement speed and harvest duration. Our experiments confirmed many (but not all) of the predictions, suggesting that harvest duration and movement speed, fundamental aspects of behavior during foraging, may be governed by a shared principle of control.},

  abstract = {Psychologists have used the semantic fluency task for decades to gain insight into the processes and representations underlying memory retrieval. Recent work has suggested that a censored random walk on a semantic network resembles semantic fluency data because it produces optimal foraging. However, fluency data have rich structure beyond being consistent with optimal foraging. Under the assumption that memory can be represented as a semantic network, we test a variety of memory search processes and examine how well these processes capture the richness of fluency data. The search processes we explore vary in the extent they explore the network globally or exploit local clusters, and whether they are strategic. We found that a censored random walk with a priming component best captures the frequency and clustering effects seen in human fluency data.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Performing everyday tasks requires the ability to search through and retrieve past memories. A central paradigm to study human memory search is the semantic fluency task, where participants are asked to retrieve as many items as possible from a category (e.g. animals). Observed responses tend to be clustered semantically. To understand when our mind decides to switch from one cluster/patch to the next, recent work has proposed two competing mechanisms. Under the first switching mechanism, people make strategic decision to switch away from a depleted patch based on marginal value theorem, similar to optimal foraging in a spatial environment. The second switching mechanism demonstrates that similar behavior patterns can emerge using a random walk on a semantic network, without necessarily involving strategic switches. In the current work, instead of comparing competing switching mechanisms over observed human data, we propose a rational account of the problem by examining what would be the optimal patch-switching policy under the framework of reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning agent, a Deep Q-Network (DQN), is built upon the random walk model and allows strategic switches based on features of the local semantic patch. After learning from rewards, the resulted policy of the agent gives rise to a third switching mechanism, which outperforms the previous two switching mechanisms. Our results provide theoretical justification of strategies used in human memory research, and shed light on how an optimal AI agent under realistic human constraints can generate hypothesis about human strategies in the same task.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
